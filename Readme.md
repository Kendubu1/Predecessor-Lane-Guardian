## Quick Start Guide (How Not to Throw Your Games) üöÄ

To make the most of your Lane Guardian do the following...
0. https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1339385702151884800&permissions=293171527744&scope=bot%20applications.commands

1. **Before You Int (Pre-Match Setup)**
   - Jump into a voice channel
   - `/pred settings` - Make sure your bot isn't speaking in cursed tongues
   - `/pred say` - Check if the volume is perfect for your precious ears or just mess with your friends
   - `/pred set_tts` - Configure the TTS voice language & accent.
   - `/pred test_voice` - Play a quick voice line to verify volume
   - `/pred list_timers ` - Review all the existing timers in place by default
   - `/pred export_config` & `/pred import_config` - Make any edits of the TTS voice lines in place!

2. **Time to Clap Some Cheeks (Game Start)**
   - When minions spawn (0:00), hit that `/pred start 0:00` like you mean it
   - Examples of what your bot will remind you about:
     - 2:00 - Ward time
     - 2:30 - Gold buff incoming 
     - 3:00 - River buffs are up 
     - 5:00 - Fangtooth joins the party 

3. **During Your Path to Victory (or Throwing)**
   - Bot's got your back with timely reminders
   - Disconnected? No problem! Use `/pred start` with current game time
   - Want some peace? `/pred stop` to shut it up

Remember: Lane Guardian is like your aggressive but loving coach to keep your 5 stack from getting distracted.
